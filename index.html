  <ol>
    <li>It was a chill December 27th evening and me and my family were still celebrating Christmas.</li>
    <li>I went to my garage to get a drink but I spotted a rat from the corner of my eye- it gave me quite the fright.</li>
    <li>I eventually lost track of it, I didn’t know what to make of it so I eventually went to bed.</li>
    <li>Fast forward 2 days, me and my family got back to chilling but there was a terrible smell filling the room.</li>
    <li>Unsurprisingly, the rat had died behind said refrigerator, so we threw him into the trash, finally achieving peace of mind from the debacle.</li>
